# Vimium 

Vimium is a browser extension that allows control using vim-type keyboard commands.

## Commands I Use Frequently

`f` - open a link in current tab  
`o` - open URL, bookmark, or history entry  
`O` - same as `o` but in new tab  
`?` - On-screen help  
`H` - Go back in history  
`L` - Go forward in history  
`ge` - edit current URL  

## Custom Key Mapping

To create custom key mapping, use `?` to bring up the help menu and select the *Options* link in the upper right (at least that's where it is for Chrome).  There is a text field labeled "Custom key mappings".  I used the following commands to make `Alt + j/k` to move left/right a tab:  
```
map <a-j> previousTab
map <a-k> nextTab
```
