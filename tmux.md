# Terminal Multiplexer (tmux)

### Fore's tmux configuration

Changes are made in ~/.tmux.conf.
* Changed prefix to `Ctrl + a` (default is `Ctrl + b`)
* Split panes using prefix (`Ctrl + a`), then | (for a vertical split) and - (for a horizontal split)
* Switch between panes using `Alt + h/j/k/l` (no prefix)
* Resize panes using prefix (`Ctrl + a`), then `h/j/k/l`
